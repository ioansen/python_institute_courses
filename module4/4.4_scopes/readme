1. a variable created inside a funtion lives only inside the funtion
2. a variable created outside a funtion lives in all the funtions as well
3. if you try to modify a variable created outside a funtion inside a funtion you will create a new variable with the same name that has the scope only in the funtion, while the one created outside it is shadowed. you can basically not assign it
4. you can actually asign it if you declate it inside the funtion with the keyword word global, then you can assign it
5. with lists, is sort of the same, if you assign the list, a new list is created, however if you modify the list, the outside list is modified as well
