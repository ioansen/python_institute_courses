one interesting thing about funtions is that they can call themselves.

these aer called recursiuve funtions. all recrusive funtions need a testing condition to end, otherwise they may run in an endless loop and give the maximum recursion depth exceeded error.

the recursive funtions can make the code much more clean and intuitive but among disadvatages we have the fact that they consume a lot of memory and sometimes harder to code (easier to make mistakes).

Take a look at the recursion.py for some examples of recursive functions
